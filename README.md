<h3>Nashville Software School, Back End Capstone, Cohort 17</h3>

<i>A web application designed to collect and store craft cocktail recipes.</i>

<p>I worked as a bartender in an upscale bar making craft cocktails. Craft cocktails, like food recipes, require precise ingredients and measurements. In the bar I worked, we had a large white binder to keep the countless recipes that were unique to our bar. Every time a guest would order a unique cocktail that we had to look up, we had to pull out the big bulky white binder for reference. I thought an app would be a much more descreet way to quickly look up a cocktail recipe. My MVP was to post and get to my API.</p>


<p>Developed as my back end capstone project for Nashville Software School.

<li>Created a clear, self-explanitory front end interface using AngularJS and Materialize</li>
